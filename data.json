			"info": "<h3>Abstract</h3><p>As technology progresses, people find themselves using computers more frequently for both personal purposes and in the workplace. They will often have duplicate applications between computers which they want configured similarly. Manually configuring each computer to achieve the same set-up can prove somewhat tiresome - there is apparent scope for a more effective solution, therefore, something concurred from user feedback.</p><p>Examination of products in this market identified that none provided an ideal, overall system; and so the concept to develop a 'Profile/Configuration Management Tool' was proposed. Its features would be an aggregation of those across existing products, coupled with relevant innovations. However, the first phase of its production would naturally be limited by the inexperience and time-availability of the developer (report author).</p><p>Through requisite phases of project management, a fully functioning, validated trial product was achieved, meeting the specified features - including real-time availability and effective security. From the project journey and evolving ideas, a variety of future work became identified - indicating scope for the product concept to be progressed further.</p><p>In summary, a system has been developed by an inexperienced code-writer, which delivers on product features that could usefully meet with potential customer needs. This is a subject area that could merit release as open source, to see what might be stimulated - something that the author suggests for considering with members of The School of Computer Science.</p><h3>System outline</h3><h4>Architecture</h4><p>The proposed system will tackle this issue by allowing users to manually exchange data between their computers and a central server. It will operate around a client-server architecture, whereby users (clients) authenticate themselves to the server. The data is securely stored against their account, on the server, and may then be routed to its correct destination on each computer, using the client interface, as required. By default, common configurations will be detected and included, such as for web browsers and email clients. Users will also be able to define their own settings for specific applications to cater for their needs, using an independently-editable document, possibly using Extensible Markup Language (XML). This file points to locations on their computers and provides relatively powerful commands for specifying which directories and files to include.</p><h4>Server</h4><p>The server will hold the latest versions of users' data, which is available on-demand, in real-time, regardless of the accessibility of the source machines. Therefore, the server acts as both: an intermediate system to coordinate client machines; and a back-up service for users' data.  Many services do not offer both of these features, but it will be an integral part of the proposed system; thus comprising some of the core functionality since they are most desirable features.</p><h4>Technology</h4><p>The whole system will be coded using Java, and therefore will be platform-independent to ensure maximum usability and compatibility between server and client. The accounts system will be implemented using an SQL database, because SQL is well regarded and can be made to interact with Java. Administrators will be able to access the accounts system using SQL's native terminal commands, on the server machine. Users' data will be stored on a specified drive/partition on the machine running the server, using the machine's file-system because Java can interact with this also.</p><h4>Graphical User Interfaces</h4><p>The client GUI will be designed to be minimal whilst intuitive, with well-tested practices. The server GUI will be terminal-based and only be available to Administrators on the machine running the server. A basic administrator GUI and account may be made available for logging in remotely to access server-side data. All sensitive data will be protected accordingly.</p><h4>Distribution</h4><p>It will be developed and released for free with the core functionality included, and a server-side size limitation per account (monitored by the server) will be considered within the project. There is scope for premium options, such as dated back-ups (which can be restored) and more server space.</p><p>Because the system gives control back to the user, allowing them to define what they transfer, it differs significantly to the various mainstream, autonomous, synchronisation systems.</p>",
